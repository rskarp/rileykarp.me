My first experience using HTML/CSS
This webpage/website was created in November 2017 as part of the application process to the DALI lab. It contains a homepage,
an about page with a short bio, a DALI page explaining my interest in the DALI lab, a resume page containing my resume as a PDF
file, and a hobbies page containg pictures of things I enjoy doing.
